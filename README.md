> End users: you do not need to read this repo. Everything you need (install one-liner, setup wizard walkthrough, troubleshooting) lives on the [`rolepod-wplab` main product page](https://github.com/nuttaruj/rolepod-wplab#readme).

> This repo is the source of the WP plugin that the MCP-side toolkit (`@rolepod/wplab`) ships an install link to. PHP plugin developers, contributors, and maintainers may continue reading.

> **Renamed in v2.0.0** from `rolepod-wplab-companion` → `rolepod-wp`. Migration note: clean break — existing v1.x installs must be deactivated + deleted, then `rolepod-wp` installed fresh. Reason in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

**WP plugin that pairs with [`@rolepod/wplab`](https://github.com/nuttaruj/rolepod-wplab) to unlock `execute-php`, runtime introspection, and the one-click "⚡ Generate setup prompt" wizard — so AI agents can pair this site with any CLI in 30 seconds instead of walking the user through App Password creation.**

Without this plugin, `@rolepod/wplab` is a complete default-safe wp-cli + REST + scoped-fs toolkit. With this plugin, the toolkit reaches the same capability ceiling as a third-party plugin — under stricter, opt-in guardrails. MIT, ~500 LOC PHP, no outbound network calls, no telemetry.

## What it adds

- **One-click pair.** Admin opens **Tools → Rolepod WP Setup → ⚡ Generate setup prompt**. Plugin mints a single-use 60-min pair token + builds a ready-to-paste prompt with CLI-specific install snippets. AI CLIs trade the token for a real WP Application Password (named `wplab-pair-<UTC-timestamp>`, revocable from `profile.php`).
- **execute-php.** Run arbitrary PHP inside the live WP request lifecycle. Two AST screens (Node side + PHP side via `nikic/php-parser`), production-block unconditional, append-only audit log.
- **Runtime introspection.** Snapshot active hooks, transients, `wp_options`, request state. List callbacks on any hook.
- **Mid-request observer + persistent PHP eval session** (`request-observer`, `php-session`).
- **wp-cli over REST** via the bundled `wp-cli.phar` — works on shared hosts where you can't install wp-cli normally (`wp-cli` endpoint).
- **Scoped fs over REST** (`fs-read`, `fs-write`) — same scope rules as the Node MCP.

## When you need it

Install **only if** you want any of: execute-php, runtime introspection, the one-click pair flow, wp-cli on shared hosts, or page-builder write surfaces that need PHP API access.

For scaffold / audit / health / REST CRUD / scoped fs workflows, the Node MCP (`@rolepod/wplab`) is enough on its own — connect via stored App Password and you get 58 of the 62 tools without ever installing this plugin.

## Install

**Option 1 — one-liner via wp-cli (stable URL, always latest):**

```bash
wp --path=<your-wp> plugin install \
  https://github.com/nuttaruj/rolepod-wp/releases/latest/download/rolepod-wp.zip \
  --activate
```

**Option 2 — WP admin upload:**

1. Download `rolepod-wp.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/nuttaruj/rolepod-wp/releases/latest).
2. WP admin → Plugins → Add New → **Upload Plugin** → pick the zip → Activate.

## After activation

1. **Settings → Rolepod for WordPress** → toggle **Enable companion REST endpoints**.
2. **Tools → Rolepod WP Setup** → click **⚡ Generate setup prompt** → copy.
3. Paste into your AI CLI (Claude Code / Cursor / Codex / Gemini). The AI runs `rolepod_wp_pair` and you're connected with full power tools.

Verify from the MCP side:

```bash
rolepod-wplab doctor    # companion handshake should report 200 OK
```

## The 10 REST endpoints

Under `/wp-json/wplab/v1/` (REST namespace retained for client compatibility — only the plugin slug + DB keys changed in v2.0.0):

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `handshake` | GET | App Password | Session token issue + capability advertise + production flag. |
| `pair/generate` | POST | `manage_options` | Issue single-use pair token (60-min TTL, 256-bit entropy, SHA-256 at rest). Max 5 active per admin. |
| `pair/redeem` | POST | pair_token | Atomic single-use redeem → mint App Password named `wplab-pair-<UTC-timestamp>`. Per-IP throttle. |
| `execute-php` | POST | App Password + session token | PHP eval. AST-screened. Production-blocked. Audit-logged. |
| `introspect` | GET | App Password + session token | Hooks / transients / options / request-state read. |
| `wp-cli` | POST | App Password + session token | Bundled wp-cli.phar passthrough (same allow-list as Node side). |
| `fs-read` | GET | App Password + session token | Scoped file read (same scope as Node MCP). |
| `fs-write` | POST | App Password + session token | Scoped file write. |
| `php-session` | POST | App Password + session token | Persistent eval context across calls. |
| `request-observer` | GET | App Password + session token | Mid-request snapshot stream. |

## Architecture

- Two admin pages: **Settings → Rolepod for WordPress** (master toggle + production hostnames + audit log viewer) and **Tools → Rolepod WP Setup** (wizard + ⚡ Generate setup prompt).
- Defence in depth: WP Application Password auth + per-session token (TTL 30 min) + **two AST screens** (Node side AND PHP side via `nikic/php-parser`) + production glob match + confirm token + append-only audit log.
- No outbound network calls. No phone-home. No telemetry. No SaaS dependency.
- Code budget: **≤ 500 LOC PHP**, lint-enforced.

## Security model

Every guarded operation passes:

1. **Application Password verification.**
2. **Per-session token check** (TTL 30 min, bound to user + app password).
3. **Production hostname block** — if `siteurl` matches an admin-configured glob pattern, refuse regardless of caller. No override.
4. **AST screen (Node side)** — payload parsed before send; reject `eval` / `system` / `shell_exec` / `exec` / `proc_open` / `popen` / dynamic include / out-of-scope file ops.
5. **AST screen (PHP side)** — re-parsed via `nikic/php-parser` inside this plugin before any eval. Defence in depth.
6. **Append-only audit log** — every call (success + reject) written to `wp_options::rolepod_wp_audit_log` (1000-entry FIFO) AND `wp-content/uploads/rolepod-wp-audit/<audit_id>.log` (mode 0600).

Pair flow adds:

- Token wire format: `rolepod_wp_pair_<48 hex chars>`. 256 bits entropy. **SHA-256 hashed at rest** in `wp_options`, raw never stored.
- **Single-use enforced atomically** (delete-before-act inside `PairToken::redeem`).
- 60-min TTL; max 5 active tokens per admin.
- Per-IP throttle: 10 failed redeems / hour via transient.

## Versioning

Plugin version tracks the MCP (`@rolepod/wplab`) family it pairs with. `MIN_COMPANION_VERSION` on the MCP side (see `rolepod-wplab/src/companion/constants.ts`) is the version floor that MCP build expects.

| rolepod-wp | Pairs with `@rolepod/wplab` | Highlights |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | 0.1 | handshake + introspect (execute-php disabled by default) |
| 0.2 | 0.2 | execute-php opt-in + bundled wp-cli + fs endpoints + observer + persistent session |
| 1.0 | 1.0 | schema-frozen + external-audited |
| 1.2 | 1.2 | Pair endpoint + Setup Wizard one-click flow |
| **2.0** | **1.3+** | **Repo + plugin slug renamed `rolepod-wplab-companion` → `rolepod-wp`. PHP namespace `Rolepod\Wp\`. Option keys `rolepod_wp_*`. Clean break — no in-place upgrade path.** |

## Build a release zip locally

```bash
./scripts/build-zip.sh              # writes dist/rolepod-wp.zip
./scripts/build-zip.sh --upload     # also uploads to the matching gh release tag
```

The zip excludes `.git`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — only runtime files ship. CI does this automatically on `v*` tag push (see `.github/workflows/release.yml`).
